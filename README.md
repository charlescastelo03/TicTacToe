# Tic Tac Toe

<h3> How To Play</h3>
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played by two players.
Here are the basic rules:

<dl>
<dt>Game Board:</dt> 
Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to mark a space in the grid with their respective symbol: one player uses <strong>'X'</strong> and the other uses <strong>'O'</strong>.

<dt>Objective:</dt>  
The main goal is to get three of your own symbols in a row, that can occur <strong><i>horizontally</i></strong>, <strong><i>vertically</i></strong>, or <strong><i>diagonally</i></strong>.

<dt>How to Play:</dt> 
Players decide who goes first. Traditionally, one player is 'X' and the other is 'O'.
Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square on the grid.
The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
<i>If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three symbols in a row, the game is considered a <strong>draw or tie</strong></i>.

<dt>Strategy and Tactics:</dt>
Players should attempt to block their opponent from creating a line of three while working to create their own line. Strategic placement of symbols is key to winning.

<dt>End of Game:</dt> 
The game ends when one player wins by connecting three of their symbols in a row or when all squares are filled, leading to a tie.
